This project was created and submitted as part of the **LambdaTest Playwright Java 101 Certification**.  
It showcases my ability to automate end-to-end UI scenarios using **Microsoft Playwright**, **Java**, **Maven**, and **TestNG**.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Highlights

- Built using the **TestNG testing framework**
- Uses **Playwright for Java** for browser automation
- Modular project structure with reusable components
- Includes a **BaseClass** for Playwright setup and teardown
- Executes functional cross browser tests and generates clean HTML reports

## üöÄ Selenium Grid Configuration on LambdaTest

As part of the testing setup, I configured a **Selenium Grid** on the **LambdaTest** cloud platform, enabling seamless execution of tests across multiple environments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Highlights:
- **Remote Test Execution:** Executed tests directly from my local setup, leveraging LambdaTest's cloud infrastructure.
- **Parallel Testing:** Ran tests in parallel across various browsers and operating systems, ensuring faster feedback and broader test coverage.
- **Scalability:** Utilized the power of cloud infrastructure for efficient and scalable **cross-browser testing**.

This setup ensures maximum test efficiency and reliability in a cloud-based testing environment, providing flexibility to scale as needed.

By using LambdaTest's infrastructure, I was able to significantly reduce test execution time while ensuring that the tests were performed in real browser environments across different platforms.


## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Browser automation using Playwright for Java
- Java programming with object-oriented design
- Integration of **TestNG** for structured test execution
- Maven for build and dependency management
- Reusable code using `BaseClass` and `PageObject` model
- Test report generation and result analysis
- Clean separation of test logic and configuration
